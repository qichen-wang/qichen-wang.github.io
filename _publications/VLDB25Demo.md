## Abstract
We will demonstrate Quorion, a query rewriter with theoretical guarantees and better practical performance.  Quorion adopts some of the recently developed query planning methods that provide optimality guarantees, including Yannakakis+, an optimized version of the Yannakakis algorithm, generalized hypertree decompositions (GHD), GYO reduction, and cost-based optimization.  Quorion also provides a platform for users to explore different query plans for a given query through a web-based interface and compare their performance with classical query plans.  Quorion currently supports DuckDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, and can be connected to any user-provided database easily through a JDBC connector.
