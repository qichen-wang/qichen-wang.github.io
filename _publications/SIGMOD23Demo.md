## Abstract

We will demonstrate SparkSQL+, a SQL processing engine built on top of Spark.  Unlike the vanilla SparkSQL that uses classical query plans, SparkSQL+ adopts some of the recently developed new query plans including generalized hypertree decompositions (GHD), worst-case optimal join (WCOJ) algorithms, and conjunctive queries with comparisons (CQC). SparkSQL+ also provides a platform for users to explore different query plans for a given query through a web-based interface, and compare their performances with classical query plans on the same Spark core.
